## Project Wealth and Wisdom: Unveiling the Contrast between Richness and Science

**Research Questions:**

This project revolves around two key questions: firstly, how does Wattles utilize words like "rich," "wealth," and "money" to inspire readers, and secondly, how does he employ terms like "science" and "law" to establish credibility and present a rational system for wealth creation? These questions are grounded in the New Thought Movement and early 20th-century mental healing practices, contributing to the study of motivational literature and its impact on perceptions of wealth and success.

**Data Used:**

The primary data source is "The Science of Getting Rich" by Wallace D. Wattles, published in 1910. Extracted from Project Gutenberg, the text underwent preprocessing, including removal of cover and table of contents, regularizing case, and eliminating irrelevant words to focus on core content.

**Data Processing:**

To prepare the text for analysis, we employed various techniques. Regular expressions removed unnecessary line breaks and special characters. The text was converted to lowercase for uniformity, and common English stop words, along with specific irrelevant words, were eliminated. Word frequency analysis using NLTK, sentiment analysis with TF-IDF, and VADER, as well as a chi-squared test for independence, were performed. Additionally, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling provided insights into thematic composition.

**Analysis Results:**

The analysis revealed the prominence of the term "rich," its role in conveying key concepts, and a predominantly positive sentiment throughout the text. The chi-squared test established a statistically significant relationship between sentiment and richness-related words. LDA highlighted a nuanced emphasis on the intellectual aspects associated with "science" for wealth creation.

**Critical Analysis:**

Potential bias arises from ambiguity in richness-related terms and reliance on common synonyms, impacting interpretation. The use of pre-trained models (TF-IDF, VADER) without detailed evaluation poses a risk of overfitting. The stochastic nature and preprocessing of LDA may lead to under-representation.

**Trustability and Further Steps:**

To enhance trustability, fine-tuning models for context-specific relevance is recommended. Evaluating LDA sensitivity and exploring alternative methodologies can improve robustness. Addressing bias through refining richness-related terms, model evaluation, and tuning will contribute to a more accurate analysis.
